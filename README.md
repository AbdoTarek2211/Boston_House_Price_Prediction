Boston Housing Dataset Analysis and Modeling
Overview

This repository contains Python code for analyzing the Boston Housing dataset and building predictive models for housing prices using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston, Massachusetts. It has been used extensively in the data science community for learning and benchmarking purposes.

Description

    The analysis begins with loading the dataset and performing basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and distribution of the data.
    Data preprocessing steps include checking for missing values, duplicate records, and outlier detection and removal.
    Feature selection techniques such as correlation analysis and SelectKBest are used to identify the most important features for modeling.
    Several machine learning models are trained and evaluated on the dataset, including Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest Regression.
    Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to optimize the model performance.
    The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score.

Results

    Linear Regression model achieved an MSE of approximately 21.52 and an R2 score of about 0.71.
    Support Vector Regression (SVR) with a linear kernel achieved an MSE of around 25.63 and an R2 score of approximately 0.66.
    Random Forest Regression performed the best with an MSE of about 9.62 and an R2 score of around 0.87 after hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion

    Random Forest Regression outperformed other models in terms of predictive accuracy for the Boston Housing dataset.
    The choice of preprocessing techniques and feature selection methods significantly impacts the model performance.
    Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV can further improve the model's performance.
